<p>Afterwards, I logged into my pi via remote desktop to view the plots from executing the example code in /iot/lesson8, including histograms, box plots, regression, interpolation, classification, cross-validation (CV), and support-vector machine (SVM):</p>

## Lab 8B

<p>After gathering data from the rpidata python code from last lab, I converted the google sheets file to a .csv and modified the code to generate the graphs of my recorded data:</p>

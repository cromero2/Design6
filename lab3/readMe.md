# Lab 3

<p>For this lab, I logged into my pi from my laptop after connecting both to my personal hotspot, then checked that I had python3 installed. I'd already installed it, so I just updated it and installed necessary packages using the following commands</p>

  > sudo apt install jdcal
> 
  > sudo apt install astral
> 
  > sudo apt install geopy
> 
  > sudo apt install pytz

<p>Then, I went through the example files in the specified directory</p>

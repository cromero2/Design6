# Lab 4

<p>For this lab, I logged into my pi from my laptop after connecting both to my personal hotspot, then followed the instructions posted for a MariaDB server, acquired a google API key, and ran the server from my Pi. Below you can see a screenshot of my command terminal</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot I took of the weather app from inside a chromium tab on my raspberry pi</p>

<p> After that, I edited the settings.py file to add the asterisk and be able to access the website from my laptop</p>

After setting up the mycpu example however, I was unable to view the /home/ part of the server at all. I got an error that seemed to be related to the views.py file. The error I received is below:

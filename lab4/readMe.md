# Lab 4

<p>For this lab, I logged into my pi from my laptop after connecting both to my personal hotspot, then followed the instructions posted for a MariaDB server, acquired a google API key, and ran the server from my Pi. Below you can see a screenshot of my command terminal</p>

<p>Finally, for this lab we were instructed to start up a Flask Server that would display "Hello World!" when you connect to the server via chromium. Below is a screenshot of my browser on the pi:</p>

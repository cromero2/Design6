## Lab 6

<p>This lab I installed NodeJS for my Raspberry Pi. I started the first server "hello-world.js", with an included personal touch. You can see that I connected to the pi via a remote desktop connection and accessed 127.0.0.1:3000 on the pi itself below:</p>

<p>I ran the second example which allowed you to see requests from connections to the server, again with included personal touch. You can see a screenshot below: </p>

<p>The final code that I ran for this part of the lab was the http.js, which counted and wrote to a file the number of times the webpage had been refreshed. I tried to reset the counter and accidentally received a 'NaN' output. However, I eventually fixed it, which can be seen below</p>

<p>And for the final part of the lab, I installed pystache and ran the example code as shown in the instructions:</p>
